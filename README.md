# Development
Centrum is a project i made as part of a new project a week type deal, so its rough and very much still in its infancy. However, I do have plans to add a hub server that can manage multiple centrum instances to a client user panel as this is limited to a panel for each centrum application. Bundling the client into the application would also be a good idea.
